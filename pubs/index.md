   <p id="abs_j6"> <i> We propose a variable metric framework for minimizing the sum of a self-concordant function and a possibly non-smooth convex 
function, endowed with an easily computable proximal operator. We theoretically establish the convergence of our framework 
without relying on the usual Lipschitz gradient assumption on the smooth part. An important highlight of our work is a new 
set of analytic step-size selection and correction procedures based on the structure of the problem. We describe concrete 
algorithmic instances of our framework for several interesting applications and demonstrate them numerically on both 
synthetic and real data. </i> </p>

  <p id="abs_j5"> <i> Real-world data typically contain repeated and periodic patterns. This suggests that they 
  can be effectively represented and compressed using only a few coefficients of an appropriate basis (e.g., 
  Fourier and wavelets). However, distance estimation when the data are represented using different sets of 
  coefficients is still a largely unexplored area. This work studies the optimization problems related to 
  obtaining the tightest lower/upper bound on Euclidean distances when each data object is potentially compressed 
  using a different set of orthonormal coefficients. Our technique leads to tighter distance estimates, which 
  translates into more accurate search, learning and mining operations directly in the compressed domain. We 
  formulate the problem of estimating lower/upper distance bounds as an optimization problem. We establish 
  the properties of optimal solutions and leverage the theoretical analysis to develop a fast algorithm to 
  obtain an exact solution to the problem. The suggested solution provides the tightest estimation of the 
  Euclidean norm or the correlation. We show that typical data analysis operations, such as nearest-neighbor 
  search or k-Means clustering, can operate more accurately using the proposed compression 
  and distance reconstruction technique. We compare it with many other prevalent compression and 
  reconstruction techniques, including random projections and PCA-based techniques. We highlight a 
  surprising result, namely that when the data are highly sparse in some basis, our technique may 
  even outperform PCA-based compression. The contributions of this work are generic as our methodology 
  is applicable to any sequential or high-dimensional data as well as to any orthogonal data transformation 
  used for the underlying data compression scheme. </i> </p>
