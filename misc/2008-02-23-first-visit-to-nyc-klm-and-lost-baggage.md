title: First visit to NYC, KLM and lost baggage
---

I've just arrived in New York and is sitting here in my room at the Waldorf=Astoria – without any luggage! (Surpriiiise!) We flew with KLM and man they got a lot of things wrong. We almost missed our transfer in Amsterdam and (then, of course our luggage got left behind).

This is my first visit to NYC and it's pretty exciting. Has shot a few pics already and tomorrow we will shop some clothes and have a first look at the city.

Stockholm – No snow.
New York – Snow.
