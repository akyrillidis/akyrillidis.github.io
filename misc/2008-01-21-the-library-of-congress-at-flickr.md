The goal is to increase the profile of their archive of over 14 million prints, photos and other visual materials (and to demonstrate that government collections can be surprisingly cool).

They're kicking things off by posting around 3,000 images from several of their most popular collections: News in the 1910s and the 1930s-40s in Color.
