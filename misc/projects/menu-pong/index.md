# Menu Pong

Take a break from work and play a game of classic Pong — in the menu bar. Like dancing without actually dancing.

### Features

- Play against the computer
- Play against a friend on the same keyboard (player 2 uses W and S keys to move her paddle)
- There's a ball involved. And paddles. Feature!

It's pretty awesome.
