title: Flickr and PHP
---

A friend of me, <a href="http://altnet.se/">Fredrik Stark</a>, just came across <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/uploads/flickr_php.pdf">this presentation</a> from the dudes at <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, about how it&#8217;s built and how they use <a href="http://php.net/"><span class="caps">PHP</span></a>, <a href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as well as other technologies.</p>


				<p>The presentation also outlines hardware and software architecture, why <span class="caps">PEAR</span> is stupid, some intruiging load statistics, why <span class="caps">PHP 4</span> sucks, how java works and alot of other things.</p>


				<p>Even if you&#8217;re not as intrigued as me about this, you should flip through it anyway, because of the funny details.</p>
