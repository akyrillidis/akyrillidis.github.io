title: Le Flash week
---

This week is to be remembered as the "Flash week". Or maybe not. Well, however, I've solved two major flash-problems today. One is making an true-to-the-eye dynamic animation of a page turn. Using basic math and having gemetrical relations in mind I finaly made it! I'm sooo happy! Ha, ha!
<br/>
The other wonder of Flash is the somewhat silly imageviewer. The "print"-section is now up and it is running this brand new image viewer. It works great because of the yummy dynamic jpg loader in MMF 6. 
<br/>
peace to ya all!
