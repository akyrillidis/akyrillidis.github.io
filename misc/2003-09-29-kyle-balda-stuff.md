I've been listening to Kyle Balda, 3D-animator famous world wide for features susch as Toy Story 2, Jurassic Park, Monsters inc., Day of the tentacle, ao. Intresting, even dough it's not my field. Also, I've accepted the mission to make a free site for Rännstensfilm, a small and independent movie co. situated here in Trollhättan.
