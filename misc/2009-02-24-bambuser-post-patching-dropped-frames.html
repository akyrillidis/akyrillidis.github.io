title: Bambuser post-patching dropped frames
---

Today the Swedish video-tech startup <a href="http://bambuser.com/">Bambuser</a> announced a really cool thing â€“ frames dropped during broadcast are patched in a post-step, providing stutter-free on-demand/offline video. From <a href="http://bambuser.blogspot.com/2009/02/bambuser-proudly-present-to-you-lowest.html">the announcement</a>:

<blockquote>In order to keep you as close to real-time as possible we drop a few frames here and there which often still allows you to get a good video - even in poor conditions. However, in areas with very poor network or when loosing the connection every now and then, this has compromised the flow and quality of the on-demand video.

The new beauty; We now store any dropped frame or audio that can't get through while you're live and give you the option to complete your video with this data immediately after your live broadcast. This allows us to keep latency at an absolute minimum while also providing you with a perfect video when watching on demand!</blockquote>
