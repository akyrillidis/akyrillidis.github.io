title: World Cup logo protest from Africa
---

A bunch of African designers are pissed for being excluded from the loop of graphically profiling the 2010 FIFA World Cup, scheduled to be <a href="http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,101476,00.html">hosted in South Africa.</a> They started a site called <a href="http://www.notthe2010logo.co.za/">Not The 2010 Logo</a>. This is pretty funny and interesting.

From the site:

<blockquote>This website was created simply as a portal for designers who felt that they were unjustly excluded from the opportunity to design an emblem or logo for the 2010 World Cup. Many designers feel that the current logo is not a good reflection of SA design and this website affords them the opportunity to submit their own creations. Your logo will not become the official logo by any means, but you can win some great prizes for your efforts and become recognised as creating the best unofficial logo.</blockquote>
