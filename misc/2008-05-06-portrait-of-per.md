I like this picture so much I just had to post it here.
<small>(<em>Hasselblad 500 C/M on Portra 160VC</em>)</small>

The funny thing is, the originals where lost somewhere between Stockholm and Fujilab in Germany. So, the only thing I have left is this crappy scan from a small paper copy. Damn you, Fuji!
