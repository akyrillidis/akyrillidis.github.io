This Monday, at 1700 hours UTC, [Andreas](http://suprb.com/) & me released the new version of [Dropular](http://dropular.net/).

We have written the entire site in JavaScript -- both the client and the server -- which was a challenge indeed. There are still loads of smaller and larger [features to come](http://dropular.net/#about/todo). If you're interested, make sure to keep an eye on [our blog](http://dropular.tumblr.com/) and [@dropular at Twitter](http://twitter.com/dropular).
