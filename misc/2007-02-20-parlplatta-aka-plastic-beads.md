title: Pärlplatta aka Plastic Beads
---

A “Pärlplatta” is plastic beads melted together by ironing.
			I made <a href="http://hunch.se/stuff/beads.swf">this really simple, yet fun Flash app</a> which makes “pärlplattor” out of ordinary images.</p>


				<p><a href="http://hunch.se/stuff/beads.swf"><img src="/resources/old/beads.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


				<p>I used the bitmap class, available in Flash 8 and later, to &#8220;pixelate&#8221; the original, then draw vector &#8220;beads&#8221; on top of every pixel.</p>


				<p><a href="http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/">Flickr Toys</a> implemented this after I gave them the source. Neat!
