title: Hovden Stitch
---

I've completed a new typeface. It's a sweet little thing called <i>Hovden Stitch</i>. Yes your guess was correct. It looks like stitches, cross-stitches to be precise. Go get it for your mac or pc right <a href="misc_stuff.asp#hovdenstitch">here</a>. Yesterday I hung out on a free festival here in Trollhättan. <a href="http://www.labrador.se/artists/laurelmusic.php3" target="_blank">Laurel Music</a> was great. <a href="http://www.virgin.se/musik/paola/" target="_blank">Paola</a> sucked. Laurel Music is playing at the next <a href="http://www.jonasbeijer.com/pianobaren/feber/" target="_blank">Club Feber</a> in Trollhättan.
