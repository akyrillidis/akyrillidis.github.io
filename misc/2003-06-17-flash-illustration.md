Yesterday me and <a href="http://www.cryostasislab.nu" target="_blank">Isak</a> had a discussion about how we illustrate using reference photos. I use illustrator, he use flash, so we made an exchange. <a href="Javascript:showme('gfx/illustration/gulie.jpg')">Gulie</a> (<a href="http://212.37.105.37/inc/r/u/gulie_overview.jpg" target="_blank">how?</a>) is my first flash-only illustration ever. Thanks mate!
