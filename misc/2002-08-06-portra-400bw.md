When I surfed the Kodak Film site and looked at my favourite serie of films, I desicovered somthing special! The Kodak Portra 400BW - B/W film with the ablilities of Portra. But here comes the real chock: <u>It develops in C-41 processes!</u> The one used for normal neg color film!! And it prints on common neg color paper! This is the first BW C-41 film wich gives pro quality!<b>USE IT BABY!</b>
