I shot the first serious session with my new <a href="http://www.elinchrom.com/">Elinchorm D-Lite</a> compact flashes last tuesday. After about 4 hours they both started shutting down because of the built-in overheat protection. Obviously that's what you get when you remove fans from the construction. However, they cooled of pretty fast so I was able to use one and have the other one cool down and still shoot pictures.

I have the 200W version which proved to be more than enough for the (studio and open-area) shots we were doing. I can with good confidence recommend those flashes to anyone who deals with part-time or hobby photography, like myself. The "price vs quality & functionality"-factor is really good. Sturdy construction (even though a bit plastic) and has all the basic features like slave, modeling lamp, etc.
