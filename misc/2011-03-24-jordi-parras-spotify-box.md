Fellow designer [Jordi Parra](http://zenona.com/) recently finished his masters degree project ["Spotify box"](http://blog.zenona.com/) — a beautiful little radio-like device which plays music through the [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) platform. What's really neat about Jordi's Spotify box—except from its gorgeous design—is that it brings back the physical interaction with music as an object, but adjusted to the 21st century. A playable item is represented by a small token, conveying a link by wireless RFID technology.

See for yourselves:
