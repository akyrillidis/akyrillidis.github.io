I received this wonderfully rugged aerogramme from a dear friend doing research work in India. Love the feeling of these kinds of things, where the material or packaging itself tells a story, giving a whole new depth of the actual message. The fact of the message being written on the inside of the envelope gives that feeling a boost.

Thank you Sofia!
