title: writing apple-history

Yesterday, history was written. Apple introduced the very first "peoples" mac, starting at only $499. It's called <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" target="_blank">Mac Mini</a>. Everyone who always wanted a new mac, but couldn't afford it, now have their chance! Except from it being cheap, it's astonishing beautiful. About 5 x 16 x 16 cm in size, it fits on most peoples desktops. I truly think this will be a top-seller and give Apple some new switchers from the pc-hell.
