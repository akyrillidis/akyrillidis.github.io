title: BON redesign hit the shelves
---

But do we really need <a href="http://www.bonmagazine.com/">BON magazine</a>? I was a dedicated subscriber from day one, until suddenly BON started acting as they were God of fashion â€“ "this skirt is exactly like Someob Scurething only me and one other person in the world has seen". This over-saturated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitism">elitism</a> the magazine suddenly expressed turned me off.

Today they released the first issue dressed in the new design. I like the logo and especially it's colors.
