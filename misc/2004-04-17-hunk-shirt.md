Well. I've now seen the last episode of Taken and must admit it was a good serie, but the last two episodes turned out to be kind of booring. I've also seen Starsky &#38; hutch, wich was a good laugh. Photo of a new Hunk-shirt is now displayed in my <a href="http://rasmusandersson.se/rp14/print.xhtml">print</a>-gallery. Another big news for the world is that my .se-domain is now up n' running.
