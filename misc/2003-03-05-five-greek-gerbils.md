title: Five greek gerbils
---

I haven't seen five greek gerbils this week. Acctually I've never seen greek gerbils at all, but I've made a new look on bodil. It will be the base for my new little wonder to come. <a href="http://rasmusandersson.se/rp13/gfx/misc_screens/20030306@1415.jpg" target="_blank">Check this out</a>. Based on WinXPSP1 + dll-mods + msstyle. Fast but not furious.
