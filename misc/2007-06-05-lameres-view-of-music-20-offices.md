<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/">Paul Lamere</a> lists <em>Offices of Music 2.0</em> and of course <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/offices_of_music_2_02">he mentions our office</a>.

<blockquote>The rainbow room at Spotify - it's in the city, has natural light, nice whiteboards, funky curtains and a tablecloth. This has a nice European feel to the space.</blockquote>

Update: <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/offices_of_music_2_014">Offices of Music 2.0 - Spotify</a>
