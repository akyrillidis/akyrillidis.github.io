Today (Oct 7th, 2009) was the 1 year anniversary of the [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) desktop client. We celebrated with cake, of course.

[One year ago we pushed the button](http://rsms.me/2008/10/07/spotify-official-release.html), releasing [www.spotify.com](http://www.spotify.com/) and the first public, official desktop client application.

It was a big day for all of us at Spotify -- after two years of hard work and a lot of coffee we could finally offer our creation to the world.

This is what the first version looked like:
