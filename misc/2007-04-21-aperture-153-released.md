title: Aperture 1.5.3 Released
---

<img src="/attachments/2007/04/aperture.png" alt="" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;" />My favourite photo tool <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Apple Aperture</a> has been updated.
Aperture 1.5.3 addresses issues related to overall reliability and performance in a number of areas, including:
<ul>
	<li>Generation of thumbnails for adjusted images</li>
	<li>Entering and exiting Full Screen mode</li>
	<li>Working with large sets of keywords in the Keywords HUD</li>
	<li>Restoring from a vault</li>
</ul>

Among the specific issues that have been addressed:
<ul>
	<li>Previews now update properly when images are sent to an external editor.</li>
	<li>Leaf Aptus 22 and Aptus 75 images are now imported with the correct orientation.</li>
	<li>When folders are imported as projects, the folder structure is now correctly preserved when identically named subfolders are included in the hierarchy.</li>
	<li>Reconnecting referenced images that have been externally edited now works more reliably.</li>
	<li>Setting the ColorSync profile in the Aperture Print dialog now correctly suppresses color management settings in the Mac OS X Print dialog.</li>
</ul>

I also noted the addition and update of several UI-interface element, among those a toolbar button for quickly printing a Contact Sheet.

However, I can't find a way to get it into my toolbar. (You can of course still print contact sheets by selecting a few thumbs and hit Apple+P)
