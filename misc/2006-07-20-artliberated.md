An intresting new site.</p>

<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.artliberated.org/">artliberated.org</a>:</p>

<blockquote>...The Artliberated Network will consist of unique professionals in art, law and research. And support visual artists when a work is confronted with legal threats and when a work is being censored either on moral or on copyright grounds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Artliberated Network will work as the needed stabilizer between the artist and censorship opponents by providing the artist with power and knowledge. And will provide hands on help with specific case and provide general guiding how to act in copyright matters in the visual arts&#8230;</blockquote>
