title: my first java app
---

I've made my first useful java application. A minimal, platform independent HTTP-server. Fire up a webserver in 5 seconds. This bastard also features a Basic Pre Processor. Source included. You'll find it <a href="misc.apps.asp">here</a>. Download directly: <a href="etc/apps/fjhttpd_12.zip">fjhttpd_12.zip</a>.
