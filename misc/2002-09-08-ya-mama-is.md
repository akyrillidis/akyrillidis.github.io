He, he. After some casual bugchecking I found a nasty little bastard in the babeview function at the babe test. You may have noticed that flipping pages isn't too logical. No. But it is now. For you tech-guys; i did the classic count-by-id error! Ha, ha... But i solved it with ADOX.

This news column has also changed a bit! Dough it has only changed cosmetically, there is some neat improvement made through using an iFrame solution. The main advantage of the change is that I now doesn't have to fit in the textrows so damn precisely! Now it's roam-time!
