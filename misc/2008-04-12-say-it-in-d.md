title: Say it in D
---

I just <a href="http://trac.hunch.se/rasmus/wiki/GDC_with_Tango">released</a> a true Mac-style simple installer package which gives you a complete <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/overview.html">D</a> with <a href="http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango/">Tango</a>-programming environment.

Included is <a href="http://dgcc.sourceforge.net/">GDC</a> with <a href="http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango/">libgtango</a> together with a complete set of D and Tango documentation as well as about 50 different examples with complete source code. Installs into standard paths and does not interfere with your current environment (using isolating prefix /usr/share/gdc). This package does <em>not</em> require <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/">Apple Developer tools</a>, even though it is highly recommended.

<a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/overview.html">D</a> is a general purpose systems and applications programming language. It is a higher level language than C++, but retains the ability to write high performance code and interface directly with the operating system API's and with hardware. D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million line programs with teams of developers. D is easy to learn, provides many capabilities to aid the programmer, and is well suited to aggressive compiler optimization technology.

    /* Shows how to create a basic socket client, and how to converse
       with a remote server. */
    import tango.io.Console;
    import tango.net.SocketConduit, 
           tango.net.InternetAddress;
    
    void main() {
      // make a connection request to the server
      auto request = new SocketConduit;
      request.connect(new InternetAddress("localhost", 8080));
      request.output.write("hello\n");
    
      // wait for response (there is an optional timeout supported)
      char[64] response;
      auto size = request.input.read(response);
    
      // close socket
      request.close;
    
      // display server response
      Cout(response[0..size]).newline;
    }
