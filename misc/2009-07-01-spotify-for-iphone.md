Late last week we put the finishing touches to a very special project we’ve been wanting to share with you for a while now. After many weeks of burning the midnight oil at Spotify HQ in an effort to squeeze into it every drop of musical goodness, we’ve finally completed work on the [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) app for the iPhone and sent it over to the nice people at Apple.

We also <a href="http://www.spotify.com/blog/archives/2009/07/27/spotify-for-iphone/">wrote about this in the Spotify blog</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8169971.stm">BCC picked it up</a> (on their front page news).

Here's the playlist we used in the video: <a href="spotify:user:rasmus:playlist:608xY9QGoZfHTXaPqnmUZF">Spotify iPhone preview video, July 27, 2009</a>.
