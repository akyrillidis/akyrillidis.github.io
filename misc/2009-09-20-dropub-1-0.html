title: DroPub 1.0
---

<a href="http://github.com/rsms/dropub#readme"><img src="http://hunch.se/dropub/icon.png" alt="DroPub" align="right"></a>I just released the first official version of <a href="http://github.com/rsms/dropub#readme">DroPub</a>. It's a mute little OS X application which makes drop boxes and sending stuff to remote servers as simple as it gets — just put a file in a regular folder and you're done.

Try it out — simply <a href="http://hunch.se/dropub/dist/dropub-1.0.zip">download</a>, double click and create a folder.

Uses SCP (secure copy over SSH) and thus you need to <a href="http://macnugget.org/projects/publickeys/">add your SSH key to the remote server</a> in order for things to work. A future version will introduce storing of passwords in the KeyChain.

Virtually unlimited number of folders can be watched and configured.
