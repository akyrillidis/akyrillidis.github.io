Currently, I'm a Simons PostDoc member of the [Wireless Networking & Communications Group](https://wncg.org/) (WNCG) at [the University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/), working with [Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html), [Alex Dimakis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/) and [Sujay Sanghavi](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/). 
I received my Ph.D. at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL), Switzerland.

My research interests include (but are not limited to) convex and non-convex analysis and optimization, data analysis and mining, structured low dimensional models and machine learning.
