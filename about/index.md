My name is Anastasios Kyrillidis (Αναστάσιος Κυριλλίδης), but most people call me by the nickname 'Tasos' ('Τάσος'). Currently, I'm a Goldstine
Fellow at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center (NY).

Prior to that, I was a Simons Foundation PostDoc member at the University of Texas at Austin. 
I finished my PhD at the CS Department of EPFL (Swtizerland).

My research interests include (but not limited to):
* Optimization for machine learning
* Convex and non-convex algorithms and analysis
* Large-scale optimization
* Every problem that includes a math-inspired criterion and needs an efficient way for its solution.
