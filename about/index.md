My name is Anastasios Kyrillidis (Αναστάσιος Κυριλλίδης), but most people call me by the nickname 'Tasos' ('Τάσος'). Currently, I'm a Simons 
PostDoc member of the [Wireless Networking & Communications Group](https://wncg.org/) (WNCG) 
at [the University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/), working with 
[Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html), 
[Alex Dimakis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/) and [Sujay Sanghavi](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/). 

My research interests include (but are not limited to) convex and non-convex analysis and optimization, 
data analysis and machine learning.
