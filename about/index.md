My name is Anastasios (Tasos) Kyrillidis and, currently, I'm a PostDoc member of the [Wireless Networking & Communications Group](https://wncg.org/) (WNCG) at [the University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/), under the supervision of [Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html), [Alex Dimakis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/) and [Sujay Sanghavi](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/). 
During my Ph.D. studies, I was under the supervision of Prof. [Volkan Cevher](http://lions.epfl.ch/volkancevher) and member of the [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](http://lions.epfl.ch/home) (LIONS lab) at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL), Switzerland.

I feel fortunate to have received my 5-year diploma and my M.Sc. on Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at the [Technical University of Crete](http://www.tuc.gr/3324.html). 

My research interests include machine learning, convex and non-convex analysis and optimization, data analytics and mining, structured low dimensional models, compressed sensing.
