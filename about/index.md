My name is Anastasios Kyrillidis (Αναστάσιος Κυριλλίδης), but most people call me by the nickname 'Tasos' ('Τάσος'). 
Currently, I'm a Noah Harding Assistant Professor at the Computer Science department at Rice University. 

Prior to that, I was a Goldstine
PostDoctoral Fellow at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center (NY), and a Simons Foundation PostDoc member at the University of Texas at Austin. 
I finished my PhD at the CS Department of EPFL (Switzerland).

My research interests include (but not limited to):
* Optimization for machine learning
* Convex and non-convex algorithms and analysis
* Large-scale optimization
* Any problem that includes a math-driven criterion, and requires an efficient method for its solution.
