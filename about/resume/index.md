## Introduction

I'm a Swede who started my first job as a designer in 1998. I've since worked as a creative & art director, and photographer in a number of different companies — large and small, my own and others — including Spray, Lear Corporation, Notion and Spotify. More information can be found on LinkedIn.

## Spotify

Since 2006 I've primarily worked with Spotify (a music platform). I'm the acting creative & art director, interaction designer and graphic designer as well as shooting both still and moving pictures. The brand identity (logotype, business cards, style guides, etc) is my work as well as the different end user client applications (interaction design).

## Photography

Made my first capture when I was about 6 years old. Picked up on the interest later in life, or more specifically in 1998, when I got access to a small but real photo lab. Since then I've been an active/passive hobby/pro photographer in waves.

My photos have been published world wide — print and online — in publications including The New York Times, The Guardian, Wired, BBC, Forbes and The Economist.

## Software development

Some of my active open-source projects include Smisk (web service framework) and Gitblog (blogging & publishing tool). I'm also involved (or have been involved) in a few larger projects including MacPorts, Tango (D standard library), Adium instant messager and Lighttpd. There are also a number of commercial applications I've written (for Spray, Spotify, Livebloggen, and others).

## Groups and organisations

- Was one of the leaders/managers of the youth organisation of Svensk Form (YNG) — a 100 year old, government funded organisation for Swedish designers and artists.

- I've represented northern Europe at IST (European Union).

- Together with Mattias Arrelid and Leo Giertz I've founded CocoaHeads Stockholm, a non-profit organisation for Macintosh developers in the Stockholm region of Sweden.

- During 1998-2001 I ran an online magazine about extreme sports and related local events called Team Mobile. It was my first project which generated some attention in the media.

- I'm also one of the Groupies (link to our outdated blog) — we're a small group of young Swedish designers who started working together in 2002.
