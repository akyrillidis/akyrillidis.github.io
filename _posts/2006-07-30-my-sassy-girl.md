title: My Sassy Girl
---

Just saw this really, really good Korean short called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293715/">”My Sassy Girl”</a> (or &#8220;Yeopgijeogin geunyeo&#8221; in Korean)</p>


				<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293715/"><img src="/resources/old/my_sassy_girl.png" alt="" /></a></p>


				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Based on a series of true stories posted by Ho-sik Kim on the Internet describing his relationship with his girlfriend. These were later transformed into a best-selling book and the movie follows the book closely. It describes the meeting of Kyun-woo (Cha) and an unnamed girl. Kyun-woo is shamed into assisting the girl because the other passengers mistakenly think she is his girlfriend. Once he helps her, Kyun-woo develops a deep sense of responsibility for her which enables him to tolerate (somehow) the girls abuses.</p>
