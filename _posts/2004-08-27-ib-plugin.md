i'm sick and have been home sleeping this week. Since I must always have something to do, I threw myself into the world of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaOverview/Articles/CocoaEnvironment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001929" target="_blank">Cocoa/Objective-C</a> and made <a href="/rp14/projects/fthumbnailview.xhtml">this custom NSView</a> including a Interface Builder plugin. Enjoy!
