title: War declared on IE6
---

There's currently alot of discussions and finally also action taken in order to have the lagging part of the world upgrade from the web browser Internet Explorer.

It all started with <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/02/norwegian-websi.html">Finn.no who put up a warning banner</a> for users accessing the site through an old version of IE. The buzz has grown into a wide discussion, visible in the all mighty <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23IE6">Twitter</a>, screenshots of followers on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ie6/">Flickr</a> and of course in the <a href="http://technorati.com/search/ie6">blogosphere</a>.

Now, a few of the largest swedish websites have followed (<a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/">aftonbladet.se</a>, <a href="http://idg.se/">IDG.se</a>, ...) and more to come (<a href="http://hitta.se/">hitta.se</a>, ...).

I love this thing that's happening for two reasons: 1. I still do some web and IE is always THE pain in the ass. 2. The awesomeness of the internet, the web, is clearly visible.
