title: Dont read ur mail

Hey! The worm Bugbear (Tanatos) is spreading like hell and is now the most widely spread virus. Only Klez is wider spread. This is an Alert Class 1. The worm is attached as a EXE in e-mails and uses the iframe sec-hole in IE. As usual, don't open any mails from strange addresses and with strange titles.

Also, the <a href="http://flajm.com/espresso/" target="_blank">espresso film festival</a> is going forward. (Dooh!) We're heading for a final staff meeting and tomorrow we will hopefully finish off the master tape.
