> When my eyes crossed [an] excerpt of famous type designer Frederic W. GoudyÂ´s "The Alphabet and Elements of Lettering" (1918) suddenly letters full of life showed in my mind's eye. Letters are organisms and typefaces are the species, all classified similar to biological taxonomy! I drafted this cognition in a chart for print and in order to prove my finding to the interested audience I took one step further. I surgically opened the letters S, Z, S, A, W and how contented I was to discover muscles, veins, tendons and bone just like the ones shared by so many living creatures.
