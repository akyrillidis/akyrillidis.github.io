Our paper is accepted in AISTATS conferences this year (Fort Lauderdale, Florida).

- [*Non-square matrix sensing without spurious local minima via the Burer-Monteiro approach*](/pubs/Conferences/MSLocalMinima.pdf): 
Joint work with [*Dohyung Park*](http://dhpark22.github.io/), [*Constantine Caramanis*](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html) 
and [*Sujay Sanghavi*](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/) - to be presented in AISTATS.

>**Abstract.** 
>We consider the non-square matrix sensing problem, under restricted isometry property (RIP) assumptions. 
We focus on the non-convex formulation, where any rank-$r$ matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is represented 
as $UV^\top$, where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times r}$. 
In this paper, we complement recent findings on the non-convex geometry of the analogous PSD setting [5], 
and show that matrix factorization does not introduce any spurious local minima, under RIP.
