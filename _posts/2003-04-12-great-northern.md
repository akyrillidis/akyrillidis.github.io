title: Great Northern
---

Made a website for my friends band called <a href="http://flajm.com/gn/" target="_blank">Great Northern</a>. Also, I was participating in the 10th anniversary of Magasin 15 today. I also met Josef Fares. Also, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/dna/" target="_blank">New Scientist</a>  is celebrating the 50th aniversary of the discovery of DNA.
