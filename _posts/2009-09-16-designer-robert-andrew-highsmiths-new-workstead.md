Designer Robert Andrew Highsmith's new [workstead table](http://www.workstead.com/TEMPLATES/Exciting%20Machinery_Table_1.dwt) is made of 100% reclaimed materials. The table is built from two steel stands formerly used to support the structure of a shipâ€™s hull and the tabletop is an old recycled plank door.
