<a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> replaced <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> with <a href="http://python-smisk.org/">Smisk</a> for one of its backend services, which marks the first serious deployment of Smisk! Version 1.1 is soon to be released and will be announced on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/smisk-announce">smisk-announce</a> as well as in this blog. 

Smisk boosted performance for some services in 10 multiples, when compared to Twisted.

Smisk is a high-performance web service framework, with its core components written in C, but controlled by Python. Smisk also exposes a <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a>-inspired package, adding Transparent Content Negotiation, class tree routing, templating, ORM-support, etc. Read more at the <a href="http://python-smisk.org/">Smisk website</a>.
