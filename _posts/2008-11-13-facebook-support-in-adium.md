title: Facebook support in Adium

<a href="/attachments/2008/11/adium-facebook-support.png"><img src="/attachments/2008/11/adium-facebook-support-150x150.png" alt="" title="adium-facebook-support" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-895" /></a>This might not be fancy news to you, but it was for me: <a href="http://adiumx.com/">Adium</a>, the utterly good instant messenger for Mac OS, has <a href="http://adiumx.com/blog/2008/05/facebook-chat-in-adium/">support for the Facebook chat protocol</a>, enabling you to connect and chat with friends on Facebook. No hassle with adding friends accounts, just sign in once and then you're set.

Furthermore, Adium has support for setting your <em>presence status</em> which will be delegated to Facebook (in the case you have configured a Facebook account in Adium, of course).
