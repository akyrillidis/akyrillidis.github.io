[IMG]http://www.sr.se/Diverse/AppData/Verktyg2002/images/news_images/6505.jpg[/IMG] I'll be watching the meteorescrud. The clock is 01.17 and I't has allready started. I've seen three white-blueish meteores breaken through the atmosphere outside my window for the last 15 minutes. This is a million times more thrilling than any soap opera. You'll be able to watch the filan show between 04.00 - 06.00 CET. BE THERE!
