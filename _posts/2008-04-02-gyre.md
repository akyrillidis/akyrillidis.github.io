<a href="http://gyre-omotesando.com/">Wonderful website</a> for Japanese department store Gyre, which instantly reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Maelstrom-Clarke.jpg">Harry Clarke's 1919 illustration</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Descent_into_the_MaelstrÃ¶m">"A Descent into the Malestrom."</a>. Turn up the audio volume, put on a pair of headphones and make sure your browser windows is a bit larger.
