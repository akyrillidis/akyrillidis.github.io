title: Video Rewrite
---

Excerpt from <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~bregler/videorewrite/">the website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Video Rewrite uses existing footage to create automatically new video of a person mouthing words that she did not speak in the original footage. This technique is useful in movie dubbing, for example, where the movie sequence can be modified to sync the actors&#8217; lip motions to the new soundtrack.
Video Rewrite automatically labels the phonemes in the training data and in the new audio track. Video Rewrite reorders the mouth images in the training footage to match the phoneme sequence of the new audio track. When particular phonemes are unavailable in the training footage, Video Rewrite selects the closest approximations. The resulting sequence of mouth images is stitched into the background footage. This stitching process automatically corrects for differences in head position and orientation between the mouth images and the background footage.
