Wow! Just about right now the uniqe visitors counter turned to 10000! Yeah! Thats.... great! ..or something. Well, I know I have got sem mails from you mates, but they'll be lying in that ugly inbox for a wile. I'm upgrading my computer to another type of disk controller model, so I'm having a har time battling with the nasty ACL-lists and cheap 90min CDR's. Don't count on me until next week.
