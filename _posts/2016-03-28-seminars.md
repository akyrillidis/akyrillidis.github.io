This semester I'm co-organizing the Simons seminar at UT Austin.

- [*UT Simons Seminar*](https://sites.google.com/site/utssspring16/): This is a weekly working group at the Department of Mathematics and Electrical 
Engineering at UT Austin. It is opened to anybody who is interested in topics around the 
themes of networks, random graphs, information theory and optimization, with applications 
in operations research, machine learning and computer science. 

This year, the list of speakers includes 

- [*Ahmad Beirami*](http://www.mit.edu/~beirami/)
- [*Luis Rademacher*](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lrademac/)
- [*Chinmay Hegde*](http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/)
