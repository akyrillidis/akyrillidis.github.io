title: Don't push the button
---

A fun and inspiring advertising/art project I've been involved in (wrote the server and client software) is currently running (Mon 26 – Tue 27, 2009) at Stockholm Central station.

You push a button, the huge Satio phone replica snaps a photo and publishes it instantly [on the web](http://tre.se/templates/FullSizePage.aspx?id=39296), also displaying it on a huge screen in the main hall.

The server is based on the [Nginx HTTP push module](http://rsms.me/2009/10/01/comethttp-push-with-nginx.html) and the client (the huge phone) is comprised of a Mac Mini, a standard USB camera, some wiring done by [my brother](http://andreasfabbe.se/) and a simple Cocoa application I wrote which simply takes a photo from the camera, compresses it and publishes it to the server. [Niclas Bergström](http://loveniclas.com/) wrote the front-end (HTML & Javascript).

A [The Viral Company](http://theviralcompany.com/) production.
