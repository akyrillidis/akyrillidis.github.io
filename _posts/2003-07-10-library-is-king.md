Drowe a illustration using plain ink on OH-film. Check <a href="Javascript:showme('gfx/print/hanna_ink.jpg&#38;bgc=ffffff')">it out</a> dude. Today I took a turn and went to the city Library. And you know what? I stayed there for almost 2 hours! I borrowed 7 books on asian trad. art. Happy reading...eh.
