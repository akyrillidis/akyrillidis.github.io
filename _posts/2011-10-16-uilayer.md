[UILayer](http://rsms.me/uilayer/) provides a JavaScript API on top of WebKit for working with the concept of layers. Instead of manipulating DOM elements using a myriad of mixed concepts, you go though a single, [well defined API](http://rsms.me/uilayer/#api).

If you're running a WebKit browser (Chrome, Safari, iPhone, iPad, etc), have a go with one of these:

- [Flip some pages in a flip book](http://rsms.me/uilayer/examples/flip-book.html)
- [Interactive 3D perspective](http://rsms.me/uilayer/examples/perspective.html)
- [More examples...](http://rsms.me/uilayer/examples/)
