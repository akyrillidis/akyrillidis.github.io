Artist James Houston was somewhat frustrated with <a href="http://www.radioheadremix.com/">Radiohead&#8217;s Nude Remix contest</a>, as he put it, &#8220;Nude is in 6/8 timing, and 63bpm. Most music that&#8217;s played in clubs is around 120bpm and usually 4/4 timing.&#8221; So he went an entirely different route, drawing inspiration from the lyrics and alternate title, <i>Big Ideas: Don&#8217;t Get Any</i>. From that he recreated the song using some really weird shit, a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, an Epson LX-81 Dot Matrix Printer, a HP Scanjet 3c, and a Hard Drive array, turning these weird odds and ends into his instruments.

What he ended up creating is nothing short of genius. It&#8217;s not only the way the song came out sounding, but also in the way he shot the video above. Visually it reminds of the way that Scott Hansen colors his photos, like old sun-damaged film, as well as lots of steady close up shots of all the different pieces doing their part. Radiohead needs to get this guy on the phone and have him make a commercial or something for them, I mean the video has been viewed over 100,000 times in the last 2 days alone, that&#8217;s definitely saying something. Here&#8217;s hoping we see more from this brilliant guy.
