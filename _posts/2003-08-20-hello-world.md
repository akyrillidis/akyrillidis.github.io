Latest updates are as follows: Last weekend, I joined a party at Berns in Sthlm. It was quite boring dough. I have introduced myself to ANSI C, C++ and Java. I've managed to create a couple of applications in all of the languages. Java is my favourite. Also, compare <a href="javascript:showme('stuff/kampanj_cinderella.gif&#38;lay=clean')">this ad</a> to the <a href="http://oneartrow.com/Pages/BonV_Normandie.html" target="_blank">original</a>. Shame on you.
