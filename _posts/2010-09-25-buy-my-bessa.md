title: Buy my Bessa
---

I'm selling one of my best analogue 35mm rangefinder cameras: a mint condition Voigtländer Bessa R4a, including a Ultron 35/1.7 lens. Bought new from the factory in August of 2007.

I'm selling this beautiful tool since I no longer use it (lack of time). I live in [Vasastan, Stockholm, Sweden](http://www.hitta.se/SearchCombi.aspx?SearchType=4&UserControlSearchBlock:TextBoxWhere=11362) and the stuff can be picked up in the Stockholm city area. The price is 10k SEK and the package comes in original boxes with manuals, protective covers, etc.

I've also created [a set of photos taken with this camera](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rsms/sets/72157625030146588).

*I'm also selling other photo gear — studio strobes, cameras, lenses, etc. Please contact me (leave a comment below) if there's anything special you're interested in.*
