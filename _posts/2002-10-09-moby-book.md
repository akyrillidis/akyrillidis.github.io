title: Moby + Book

Just got back from the Moby concert in Copenhagen and I can't say anything else than "Stunning". He's just great. Really! 
<br/>
Well, another really great thing here on earth is the new photo book called "Ögonblick 2002" and is a compilation of over 160 pages in full BW duplex. The best thing about it is that one of my photos is covering it. ;-) Yeah. I'm completely happy! It's only 250 SEK and contains uniqe pictures from Luleå up north to Ystad down south! All photos taken by youngsters, documenting their lives. <a href="http://www.fotoweb.o.se/fotoweb/bildstudier/order.html" target="_blank">GET IT HERE BABY!</a>  Over and out.
