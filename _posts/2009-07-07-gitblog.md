So, my blog is back up again after a month downtime. We tried to upgrade Wordpress on our server and when pressing the upgrade button, Wordpress deleted <em>every file</em> on our server (writable by the web server user). So, all 30+ web sites hosted, all Hunch Stuff from 2003 to 2009 and our Subversion repository is gone forever. Nope, we're stupid and did not have a backup.

I set out to write a better blog tool than Wordpress and here it is -- behold the mighty <a href="http://gitblog.se/">Gitblog</a>.

More info to come.
