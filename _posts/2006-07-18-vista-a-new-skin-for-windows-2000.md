title: Vista - a new skin for windows 2000
---

So, after like six years of time, all Microsoft has come up with is a <a href="http://bink.nu/photos/news_article_images/category1022/picture13552.aspx">new skin for XP</a>.</p>


				<p>That&#8217;s just ridiculous.</p>


				<p>Coman! <span class="caps">OS X</span> seamlessly renders everything directly on graphics memory while windows can&#8217;t even render subpixel type.
