title: Cleaning up your Spotify playlists
---

With the [release of playlist groups in Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/blog/archives/2010/08/24/playlist-folders/) you are now able to clean up that messy sidebar. Here's a little trick I like myself, using the magic "-" playlist separators to add "dynamic" group dividers.

1. First thing, create a new playlist group ("+" button, "File" menu or shift-command-N) and add a few playlist to the group (by dragging and dropping).

2. Select the last playlist in the group and create a new playlist (e.g. by pressing command-N)

3. Name the new playlist "-" and hit the enter key.

Now, when the group is expanded you will get a divider at the bottom, and when the group is folded there will be no divider:
