Our paper on the statistical inference capabilities of SGD is accepted at the AAAI conference next year (New Orleans, Louisiana).

Joint work with [*Tianyang Li*](http://li-tianyang.com/), [*Liu Liu*]() and [*Constantine Caramanis*](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html).

>**Abstract.** 
>We present a novel method for frequentist statistical inference in $M$-estimation problems, based on
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a fixed step size: we demonstrate that the average of such SGD
sequences can be used for statistical inference, after proper scaling. An intuitive analysis using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process suggests that such averages are asymptotically normal. From a practical perspective, our
SGD-based inference procedure is a first order method, and is well-suited for large scale problems. To show
its merits, we apply it to both synthetic and real datasets, and demonstrate that its accuracy is comparable to
classical statistical methods, while requiring potentially far less computation.
