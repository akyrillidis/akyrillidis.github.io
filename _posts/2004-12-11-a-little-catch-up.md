I haven't written anything here for a month. That's bad, right? What have I been up to then? Alot of things, one of them beeing the development of this little <a href="http://minhttpd.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http server</a>. Working together with <a href="http://www.thesundancekid.net/" target="_blank">Andreas</a> who's giving me some c++-skills. Oh, that's nice. <a href="http://flajm.se/" target="_blank">I've</a> also completed two more flash demos for <a href="http://www.sis.se/" target="_blank">SIS</a>. Made some progress om my new semi-CMS Fuse, wich will be available jan~june 2005.
<br/>
I recently came across <a href="http://www.resume.se/artikel-art_id=8856.html" target="_blank">this article</a> about ICA (primarily a big food-company) importing and selling Levi's. Wow. 
<br/>
Who doesn't love <a href="http://www.annaternheim.com/" target="_blank">Anna Ternheims</a> music? Well, everyone, have a look at <a href="http://www.digfi.com/default.aspx?id=6477" target="_blank">this</a>. And, a new version of Andreas &#38; Stoffes creation <a href="http://www.spelnyheter.se/" target="_blank">Spelnyheter</a> was let of it's cage yesterday. BTW, <a href="http://www.kraitz.se/" target="_blank">Anna Kraitz</a> is kool.
