<a href="http://www.avc.com/">Fred Wilson</a> is <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2008/09/my-web-20-keyno.html">working on his <em>Web 2.0 NYC</em> presentation</a> together with graphic designer <a href="http://www.jeremybogdan.com/">Jeremy Bogdan</a>. I think these slides provide an excellent example of how presentations could be designed, rather than constrained by the usual headline-divider-body-bullets-footer kinda template most people use.

<blockquote>The slides are designed to be "background music" for the talk I am giving. If you don't see something you think is important in the presentation, there's a good chance it's in my talk but just didn't make it onto the slides.</blockquote>
