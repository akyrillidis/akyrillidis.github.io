title: Wordpress, here I come
---

I'm giving up my old home-made RoR weblog for Wordpress. So far, some stuff do work (like writing new posts) but the sub domain
part is still not quite working.

I added a CNAME record -- Works. Changed blog URL -- works. Wrote a test post - works. The site displays my theme -- NOT works. Very strange.

Edit: Suddenly, everything seem to cope nicely. Faaantastic.
Edit: Okay, I moved it onto my own server. Much, much better. I like this tool.
