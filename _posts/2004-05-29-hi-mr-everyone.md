The last weeks I've been working my ass off, but that hasn't stopped me from continuing to reconstruct this little bastard site. However, Me and <a href="http://www.24supreme.com" target="_blank">Christian</a> have shut down our iPod mini-site, and Chrisitan is taking over <a href="http://www.ipod.se/" target="_blank">iPod.se</a> instead. I'm in it to, but I really suck on writing articles. Because we love these little iPods so f*cking much, we <a href="/rp14/photo/misc/040529_-_iPod_Mini/">bought two sweeties</a> from a Swedish guy in the US. Oh yeah! Thank you Tobias.
