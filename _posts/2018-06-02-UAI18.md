My paper on simple algorithms for low-rank approximations is accepted at the UAI conference this year (Monterey, California).

>**Abstract.** 
>We propose practical algorithms for entrywise $\ell_p$-norm low-rank approximation, 
for $p = 1$ or $p = \infty$. The proposed framework, which is non-convex and gradient-based, 
is easy to implement and typically attains better approximations, faster, than state of 
the art. From a theoretical standpoint, we show that the proposed scheme can attain 
$(1 + \varepsilon)$-OPT approximations. Our algorithms are not hyperparameter-free: they 
achieve the desiderata only assuming algorithm's hyperparameters are known a priori---or 
are at least approximable. I.e., our theory indicates what problem quantities need to 
be known, in order to get a good solution within polynomial time, and does not contradict to
 recent inapproximabilty results.
