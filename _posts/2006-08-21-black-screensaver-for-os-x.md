title: Black Screensaver for OS X
---

Ok, so <span class="caps">OS X</span> has some nice screensavers. But I don&#8217;t want a fancy-pantsy processor eating blob in 7 different colors. I want a black screen.</p>


				<p>My solution, until now, was simply to set the display-sleep-timeout lower than the start-screensaver-timeout. However, I lock my screen using top-right hot-corner for starting the screensaver, thus requiring password to get back. <small>(If I don&#8217;t lock my computer, my fellow buddies at work invites the boss for a hot night using my name. Not good. Not. Good.)</small></p>


				<p>So I made this non-animating, non-updating black screensaver.<br /></p>

				<p>It&#8217;s compiled as a &#8220;universal binary&#8221;, for both <span class="caps">PPC</span> and Intel macs. Click the icon above to download. Unzip and double-click the bastard to install it.</p>
