It's pretty simple, create a new playlist, option-click it and select "Collaborative Playlist".
Add some songs if you wish and send the link to a few friends. (you can drag the playlist into an instant messenger, a e-mail message, or simply option-click the playlist and select "Copy Link")

There is a good article in our official <a href="http://blog.spotify.com/">Spotify blog</a> called <a href="http://blog.spotify.com/archives/2008/01/30/collaborative-playlists">Collaborative playlists</a> which I recommend you have a look at.

<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/">Paul Lamere</a> has written a pretty good article too and posted one of his collaborative playlists, right here: <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/collaborative_playlists">Collaborative Playlists</a>

Here's my shared, collaborative playlists: <a href="spotify:user:rasmus:playlist:2J8yotujArLjW7jpR0Broz">Morning Glory</a> - Click the link, add something you see might fit and let's see what happens!
