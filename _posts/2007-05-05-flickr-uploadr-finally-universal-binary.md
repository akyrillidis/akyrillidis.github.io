title: Flickr Uploadr finally Universal Binary
---

Flickrs' fabulous uploading tool <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/">Uploadr</a> has, finally, been updated and now runs fast like hell on Intel-macs. Besides being a hybrid binary, some features has been added. For example image safety and type of image (photo, screenshot, etc).

There is still alot of things I miss in this application. How about being able to actually rearrange the pictures before uploading? Now you have to remove and add pictures to get them ordered as you want. And why not strip away the file extension when automatically creating titles? It's so simple a monkey without a brain can do it and I can't see how anyone would like to have "Killer Cat.jpg" instead of "Killer Cat" as the title for their photographs.
