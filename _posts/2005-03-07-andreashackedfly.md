Summary: My "odr√§gliga" brother Andreas had his 20th birthday yesterday. We wen to london and drank beer.
<br/>
The <a href="http://www.virginatlanticglobalflyer.com/" target="_blank">Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer</a> (or Steve Forsett and c/o) flew around the globe in one freaking sweep! IN 67 HOURS! Without refuling. Incredible. Same guys behind this trip as <a href="http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/index.htm" target="_blank">Space Ship One</a>.
<br/>
<a href="http://flajm.se/" target="_blank">Flajm.se</a> got hacked yesterday, by some stupid guy from Brazil. All they did was replacing the index page with some ridiculous text. All services on flajm were down for about 2-4 hours today.
