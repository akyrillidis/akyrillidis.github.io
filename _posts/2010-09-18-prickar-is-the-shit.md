title: Prickar is the shit
---

I'm going through old data backups, moving everything to a new location, and am finding a lot of long-lost goodies on my way. Like this polka dots pattern I created back in 2005 when I—for a short period of time—was kind of obsessed with tiny polka dots in slanting patterns. Yeah I know, weird.

Went as far as I printed a brochure in this pattern, which can be spotted in this photo:
