This semester I'm co-organizing two seminars at UT Austin:
+ UT Simons Seminar: This is a weekly working group at the Department of Mathematics and Electrical 
Engineering at UT Austin. It is opened to anybody who is interested in topics around the 
themes of networks, random graphs, information theory and optimization, with applications 
in operations research, machine learning and computer science. See [*here*](https://sites.google.com/site/utssfall15/)
for the seminar's schecdule.
+ WNCG Reading Group: This is again a weekly reading group with the amazing students of WNCG group 
at the Department of Electrical Engineering at UT Austin. The aim of this seminar is explore new 
research directions, as well as create collaborations between research groups of WNCG, through students' 
interactions. The topics covered at this working group range from coding theory and networks to machine learning
and optimization. See [*here*](https://sites.google.com/site/wncgreading/)
for the seminar's schecdule.
