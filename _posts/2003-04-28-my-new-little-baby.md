title: my new little baby
---

My old mobile phone just would't work anymore, so I had to get a new one. Luckfully, I got a good deal on a <a href="javascript:showme('stuff/t100_iceyfresh.jpg')">SonyEricsson T100</a> at Telia. Really love it! It got the oldschool 8-bit sounds and lies just about perfect in the pocket.
