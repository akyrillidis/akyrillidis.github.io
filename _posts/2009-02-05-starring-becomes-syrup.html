title: Starring → Syrup
---

The Swedish interactive new media bureau Starring was previously bought by <a href="http://www.lbi.com/">LBi</a> and have now gone through the transition with the new owners. The name <em>Starring</em> is now changed into <a href="http://syrupsthlm.com/"><em>Syrup</em></a> (or <em>Syrup Sthlm</em>) – a big step towards acting as the Swedish branch of the <a href="http://www.syrupnyc.com/">Syrup</a> agency (also a member of LBi).

My brother <a href="http://andreasfabbe.se/">Andreas</a> now works at <a href="http://syrupsthlm.com/"><em>Syrup</em></a> and not Starring :)
