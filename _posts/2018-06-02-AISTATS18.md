Our paper on accelerated iterative hard thresholding is accepted at the AISTATS conference this year (Lanzarote, Spain).

- [*IHT dies hard: Provable accelerated Iterative Hard Thresholding*](/pubs/Conferences/AccIHT.pdf): 
Joint work with [*Rajiv Khanna*](https://rjvak7.github.io/).

>**Abstract.** 
>We study --both in theory and practice-- the use of momentum motions in classic iterative 
hard thresholding (IHT) methods. By simply modifying plain IHT, we investigate its convergence 
behavior on convex optimization criteria with non-convex constraints, under standard assumptions. 
In diverse scenaria, we observe that acceleration in IHT leads to significant improvements, 
compared to state of the art projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe variants. 
As a byproduct of our inspection, we study the impact of selecting the momentum parameter: 
similar to convex settings, two modes of behavior are observed --"rippling" and linear-- 
depending on the level of momentum.
