Skyline loop via 9 and Bear Creek. Takes you onto a crazy bidirectional single-lane section of Skyline (35). Here's a video from a drive along this exact route: [YouTube/BlI88DRsgBQ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlI88DRsgBQ)

A fantastic route for a joyride of medium intensity through fantastic Redwood forests. Can get very foggy and slippery early in the morning and late in the afternoon during the summer.
