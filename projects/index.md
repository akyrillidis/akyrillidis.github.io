   <p id="des_s1"> <i> We propose a variable metric framework for minimizing the sum of a self-concordant function and a possibly non-smooth convex 
function, endowed with an easily computable proximal operator. We theoretically establish the convergence of our framework 
without relying on the usual Lipschitz gradient assumption on the smooth part. An important highlight of our work is a new 
set of analytic step-size selection and correction procedures based on the structure of the problem. We describe concrete 
algorithmic instances of our framework for several interesting applications and demonstrate them numerically on both 
synthetic and real data. </i> </p>
