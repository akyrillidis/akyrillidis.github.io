  <button id="b_dow_s8"> Download </button>
  <button id="b_pap_s8"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s8"> <i> This software package is a proof of concept for $UV^\top$ parameterization 
   in optimization and focuses on first-order, gradient descent algorithmic solutions for the case
   of matrix sensing. The algorithm proposed is named as Bi-Factored Gradient Descent (BFGD) algorithm, 
   an efficient first-order method that operates on the $U, V$ factors. 
   
   Subsequent versions will include more involved applications such as 1-bit matrix completion (logistic
   regression objective), low-rank image recovery from limited measurements, quantum state tomography
   settings, etc.

+ ALgebraic PursuitS (ALPS) for sparse signal recovery (Matlab)
  
  <!---<button id="b_des_s1"> Description </button>-->
  <button id="b_dow_s1"> Download </button>
  <button id="b_pap_s1"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s1"> <i> This software package implements the ALgebraic PursuitS class of methods for sparse signal recovery.
   ALPS framework includes some of the fastest Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) variants, 
   utilizing optimal subspace exploration, cheap and adaptive step size selection and Nesterov-style accelerations.
   ALPS are also backed with strong theoretical guarantees, based on RIP assumptions in compressed sensing settings.

  <button id="b_pap_s2"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s2"> <i> This software package implements the Matrix ALgebraic PursuitS class of methods for low rank recovery.
   This set of problems includes the affine rank minimization, matrix completion and PCA settings.
   Similar to the vectors case, the Matrix ALPS framework includes some of the fastest Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) variants
   for low rank matrix reconstruction,

  <button id="b_dow_s7"> Download </button>
  <button id="b_pap_s7"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s7"> <i> In this contribution, we consider
	compressed sensing for sparse and low-rank tensors. More specifically,
	we consider low-rank tensors synthesized as sums of outer products
	of sparse loading vectors, and a special class of linear dimensionality-reducing
	transformations that reduce each mode individually. We prove
	interesting "oracle" properties showing that it is possible to identify
	the uncompressed sparse loadings directly from the compressed tensor data.
	
	This Matlab demo works as a proof of concept for the main ideas in the paper.
