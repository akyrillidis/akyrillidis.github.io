   <p id="des_s1"> <i> This software package implements the ALgebraic PursuitS class of methods for sparse signal recovery.
   ALPS framework includes some of the fastest Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) variants, 
   utilizing optimal subspace exploration, cheap and adaptive step size selection and Nesterov-style accelerations.
   ALPS are also backed with strong theoretical guarantees, based on RIP assumptions in compressed sensing settings.
