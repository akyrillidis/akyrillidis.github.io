   <p id="des_s1"> <i> This software package implements the ALgebraic PursuitS class of methods for sparse signal recovery.
   ALPS framework includes some of the fastest Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) variants, 
   utilizing optimal subspace exploration, cheap and adaptive step size selection and Nesterov-style accelerations.
   ALPS are also backed with strong theoretical guarantees, based on RIP assumptions in compressed sensing settings.

   <p id="des_s2"> <i> This software package implements the Matrix ALgebraic PursuitS class of methods for low rank recovery.
   This set of problems includes the affine rank minimization, matrix completion and PCA settings.
   Similar to the vectors case, the Matrix ALPS framework includes some of the fastest Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) variants
   for low rank matrix reconstruction, 
   utilizing optimal subspace exploration, cheap and adaptive step size selection and Nesterov-style accelerations.
   Matrix ALPS are also backed with strong theoretical guarantees, based on RIP assumptions in compressed sensing settings.

+ Matrix ALgebraic PursuitS for low rank + sparse recovery (Matlab)
  
  <button id="b_des_s3"> Description </button>
  <button id="b_dow_s3"> Download </button>
  <button id="b_pap_s3"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s3"> <i> This software package is the extension of the Matrix ALPS software package for the case of
   low rank and sparse recovery. Applications include background video subtraction and robust PCA, among others.
