  <button id="b_pap_s1"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s1"> <i> This software package implements the ALgebraic PursuitS class of methods for sparse signal recovery.
   ALPS framework includes some of the fastest Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) variants, 
   utilizing optimal subspace exploration, cheap and adaptive step size selection and Nesterov-style accelerations.
   ALPS are also backed with strong theoretical guarantees, based on RIP assumptions in compressed sensing settings.

  <button id="b_pap_s2"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s2"> <i> This software package implements the Matrix ALgebraic PursuitS class of methods for low rank recovery.
   This set of problems includes the affine rank minimization, matrix completion and PCA settings.
   Similar to the vectors case, the Matrix ALPS framework includes some of the fastest Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) variants
   for low rank matrix reconstruction, 
   utilizing optimal subspace exploration, cheap and adaptive step size selection and Nesterov-style accelerations.
   Matrix ALPS are also backed with strong theoretical guarantees, based on RIP assumptions in compressed sensing settings.

+ Self-Concordant OPTimization (SCOPT) for composite convex problems (Matlab)
  
  <button id="b_des_s4"> Description </button>
  <button id="b_dow_s4"> Link to software </button>
  <button id="b_pap_s4"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s4"> <i> SCOPT  is a MATLAB implementation of the proximal gradient, proximal 
   quasi-Newton, proximal Newton, and path-following interior-point algorithms for solving 
   composite convex minimization problems involving self-concordant and self-concordant-like functions.

  <button id="b_pap_s5"> Paper </button>
   <p id="des_s5"> <i> Proof of concept why expanders accelerate execution time of convex solvers for group sparse
   recovery. The problem setting is that of group sparse convex norm minimization over linear constraints.
   The experiments include both synthetic and real data settings.
